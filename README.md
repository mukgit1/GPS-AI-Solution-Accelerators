# System Integrator Partner - AI Solution Accelerator Repository

This is a central hub for solution accelerators for Microsoft SI partners to use for building customer solutions for AI Design Wins


## Solution Accelerators

### Build your own copilot End to End Solution Accelerator
  - Production Ready Reference Solution for how to build your own copilot using Azure services including: Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, Azure OpenAI Service, Azure Kubernetes Service or Azure Container Apps. Uses Semantic Kernel plugins for OpenAI, Cosmos DB connectors, and semantic cache. Built in C#.
    - AKS or ACA, Container Registry, Managed Identity, Key Vault, Log Analytics, Azure Monitor
    - [Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/buildyourowncopilot)
    - [Hackathon Workshop - coming soon]()


## Sample Applications

### Build a copilot App in C# and Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL
  - This sample application shows how to build a Generative-AI application using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL using its new vector search capabilities and Azure OpenAI Service and Semantic Kernel. The sample provides practical guidance on many concepts you will need to design and build these types of applications.
    - Azure App Service, C#, Native SDK, Semantic Kernel
    - [Sample App](https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/cosmosdb-nosql-copilot)
    - [Hands on Lab](https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/cosmosdb-nosql-copilot/tree/start)

### Build a copilot App in Python with Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL
  - This sample demonstrates how to build a RAG Pattern application using a subset of the Movie Lens dataset. This sample will leverage the Python SDK for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL to perform vector search for RAG, store and retrieve chat history, and store the vectors of the chat history to use as a semantic cache. Azure OpenAI to generate embeddings and LLM completions.
    - Jupypter Notebook, Python, Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL
    - [Sample App](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureDataRetrievalAugmentedGenerationSamples/blob/main/Python/CosmosDB-NoSQL_VectorSearch/CosmosDB-NoSQL-Quickstart-RAG-Chatbot.ipynb)
   
### Build a Graph RAG application 
  - Cosmos AI Graph: An AI-Powered Graph and Knowledge Graph Solution with Azure Cosmos DB. Combine the power of baseline (vetor search) with the contextual and relationship data captured in  a knowledge graph to bring you RAG apps to the next level with Azure Cosmos DB.
  - Python, Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL or Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore)
