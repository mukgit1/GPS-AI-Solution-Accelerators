# System Integrator Partner - AI Solution Accelerator Repository

This is a central hub for solution accelerators for Microsoft SI partners to use for building customer solutions for AI Design Wins


## Solution Accelerators

- Build your own Copilot End to End Solution Accelerator
  - Production Ready Reference Solution for how to build your own copilot using Azure services including: Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, Azure OpenAI Service, Azure Kubernetes Service or Azure Container Apps. Uses Semantic Kernel plugins for OpenAI, Cosmos DB connectors, and semantic cache. Built in C#.
    - AKS or ACA, Container Registry, Managed Identity, Key Vault, Log Analytics, Azure Monitor
    - [Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/buildyourowncopilot)
    - [Hackathon Workshop - coming soon]()


## Sample Applications

### Build a Copilot sample app
  - This sample application shows how to build a Generative-AI application using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL using its new vector search capabilities and Azure OpenAI Service and Semantic Kernel. The sample provides practical guidance on many concepts you will need to design and build these types of applications.
    - Azure App Service
    - C#, Native SDK, Semantic Kernel
    - [Sample App](https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/cosmosdb-nosql-copilot)
